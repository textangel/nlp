Donald Trump is a moron who should have no presidency," said any reporter at any time during the event. "If we get caught with this old media clamor to say he won't even run, and then they say he won't even run, and then they see how his brother didn't do that, so they've got to go on the Hill right?" The men who joined in repeated calls for the White House to release transcripts of Trump's public statements with regard to tax returns came out

Donald Trump is a moron who should be ashamed of himself, but also willing to vote with all the country's money at risk because he could get hurt.

Breitbart News is destroying the Constitution and the Constitution of the United States, and he really is so desperate for an opportunity to do what America was built on, just to get rich and lose and he doesn't know what America is about. He was willing to fight and he was willing to fight and he lost. Now he's

Donald Trump is a moron who claims that people get trashed because he wants to get the Republican nomination. It's doubtful that Trump would have that kind of support even if he thought he could win, given the far less fundamental flaw in his platform.

Even if you think that his arguments, which include his record of attacking "nazis" on Twitter, and his frequent use of the phrase "Jeez'nazis" on social media are "lovely," in reality

Donald Trump is a moron who will only become more self-centered and authoritarian if he sees his own party taking control of the House of Representatives by 2020. Because Democrats aren't really angry about this now, it's impossible for them to remember to vote for Clinton. It should be obvious, then, that a Democratic Congress would be much more open to challenges to the power of the establishment — but it wouldn't have to be, given how confused this is, the GOP's electoral domination of the

Donald Trump is a moron who and his own administration seeks to kill off the potential children of your forebears. So why does any American in politics — from the European populists who preside over Europe's far left to the asos who control Quebec and Quebec City — think the United States should have governed France in the first place? Trump doesn't know, and he blames "many people." His rhetoric does not even address why he has singled out France in such a way. He's

Donald Trump is a moron who doesn't understand that his foreign policy is nothing but a surrender to the United States, a surrender which immediately lifts the threat posed by radical Islam to all the rest of the world. That's the question asked by the English-speaking nations that we be confronting during this time of severe troubles and the Arab Spring.

Donald Trump is a moron who blames Republicans for all that's wrong with the economy. Let him sell up to that. He may not be on the front lines fighting for economic change in the U.S., but his understanding of the difference between the left and the right is at the core of his worldview. My point is not that Trump can turn the tables on the deficit, or impose it without provoking angry reaction from the other side. My point is that the simple and obvious truth is that

Donald Trump is a moron who suddenly does things that you would never expect to happen from a traditional Republican political figure like Donald Trump.

But it might also be Trump's false premise that opposing the civil rights movement will somehow be a good thing. He is so straightforwardly false that this might become clear to a few people who read his books — he's qualified to judge this, all by himself.

Some of that could be the pernicious effect of 'identifying as Jewish

Donald Trump is a moron who lags badly, someone who is not qualified to be commander in chief. In this man you had Hillary Clinton, an insecure voter. Now you have Donald Trump.

Donald Trump is a moron who calls himself a "legitimate President," making his campaign to woo Americans who support him against all the odds seemingly a fool's errand.

Trump promised to give his supporters a few raises, and to be ruthless about it, hiring him as his chief strategist. Donald's long-term policy agenda is also closely aligned with his ambitious and aggressive strategy to bring back manufacturing jobs in the states, and protect NAFTA.

He wasn't born in the U.S. When he was asking Jewish immigrants, "Where are you from?" no one was sure, there would be not a Muslim, for instance, Trump wouldn't answer "Where are you from?" And yet he certainly won't only try to tempt people to vote with him, but he's done so by attempting to entice his most loyal supporters into polling places where they don't feel even his

Donald Trump is a moron who has become increasingly paranoid. His psychology is very complex, and in this case, if you know what I mean, you know that a lot of it in his mind is paranoia. We're not talking about gangsterism or terrorism, that's the paranoia. I mean the basic fact is that the smart — the person with actual intelligence — really seems to believe we're leaving the world around us.

Donald Trump is a moron who has no idea what he is talking about or how to talk about his foreign policy. His agenda is all he has on his plate. His message of muscular unity and rational opposition may drive the economy, but in practical terms he's nowhere near running a credible American government.

Losing his own Presidential bid is the most essential threat to Republican unity since the failed 2008 campaign of John McCain. As if by magic he did.

Donald Trump is a moron who would love to hit ISIS. And yet as he campaigns for president, as he repeatedly bombarded the Republican nominee on his disastrous attacks on the military and on the illegal immigration of the immigrants — he's attacked his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by labeling her an "enemy of the people."

The hell is that ideology
----------------------------------------
Donald Trump is a moron who has heaped on protestors. He is brash about his last-minute helpings to his bully pulpit. And he is outright committed to maintaining and expanding his phone-hacking empire while peddling attack ads and selling the disgusting and repulsive mores he casually concedes exists.

As Rand Paul, like Trump, has long contended, there is "nothing more evil" than destroying the American fabric. Moreover, Paul is perfectly comfortable in presenting himself as

Donald Trump is a moron who should be ashamed."

Hours after McCaskill launched her review, Facebook's White House chief of staff said that she had reviewed the report.

"As we have stated many times before, it is a deeply flawed report about President Trump," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement.

Neither the White House nor McCaskill responded to a request for comment.

Some of the data point to a series of missteps and accusations against

President Trump's words (outraged) were met with international condemnation, and I was so disappointed that he never said anything, let alone made so many promises!

He had to be scolded, in so many different ways.

He unleashed the most brutal racism of all.

His very "Make America Great Again" program encouraged turning back
----------------------------------------
Donald Trump is a moron who is personally unfit for office, until he retires from politics. He has no business enforcing Donald Trump's free trade agreement with Russia, using its diplomatic clout to threaten to break the United States' treaty with the bloc.

"This is not an easy decision for Senator Orrin Hatch to make," Peter Finkler, a senior counsel at First Amendment Foundation, said in a phone interview. "Orrin Hatch took our son Jamey who was a

Donald Trump is a moron who will never listen to anyone with a dollar for his food."

Donald Trump is a moron who thinks Barack Obama is a worse man than Barack Obama, but when this week's book is released, anyone who looks at a married couple will tell you a different story." - Politico

Why the first wife never likes the men she's partnered with and Trump has a "absolute list of moves where it's important to do things differently, not the same people." "He's less about his spouse and more about his supporters." - Vice

He brags
----------------------------------------
Donald Trump is a moron who isn't a deep-pocketed businessman," was this a complaint that a more influential media group like the New York Times would like to make about how the Trump phenomenon has spread throughout our country? "Not necessarily," Stephen A. Nowlan of the National Policy Institute wrote in an email to me, "but not likely." (Sorry, Big Glenn.) After reading this, we were compelled to join forces and question him about this issue. The answer is surprisingly emph
----------------------------------------
Donald Trump is a moron who is ready to blame America's failings on ignorant greed, his ego can't help but pick fights with Republicans. He'll pretend to be apologistic about "the fact that we couldn't do this," and once again, Trump is biting into your wallet in every attempt at cathartic politicking that he can muster.

The simple solution is to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, the single
----------------------------------------
Donald Trump is a moron who would rather watch a baby and also say "hey" in Spanish. How could you believe that because of his hypocrisy?"

Even Trump himself has put this episode on YouTube, which is now also a heavily monitored webpage. People around the globe have demonstrated how Trump treats people in this form of androgenism, which is quite bad in a small community like this.

Clearly there's no reasoning behind this behavior. Two individuals who know and love each other
----------------------------------------
Donald Trump is a moron who thinks Britain will become the country that it is today.

Where if it passes it will be fine because Britain will be a better place. But it is not that clean because we will be fine if it passes. It is the same exact slogan as 'David Cameron will not accept us into British societies, they will resist us and they will be a sad and cold country for many generations to come'. And now many people can see that – because all the good
----------------------------------------
Donald Trump is a moron who is completely disgraceful and profoundly wrong. The US has never had one that is standing up to the Democrats in this country. But that is something he will never learn. And at this point Donald will show no sign of taking any action to fix it.

All of us Americans need to do is figure out how to stop Donald Trump and his unhinged misogyny from his base.
----------------------------------------
Donald Trump is a moron who will not be a peacemaker. He is an expert at bringing "danger" to our allies, who he tells us have been eliminated by lethal means. Nothing in history suggests Trump understands this better than Franklin Roosevelt, who, as he used to tell his Chinese cousins, was stuck, with unpredictable opponents, in a fight against a belligerent adversary. That this leadership has never pulled its weight during his painful and terrible presidency, was an inexcusable precedent. But
----------------------------------------
Donald Trump is a moron who is neither real nor funny, is not supported by the media, is politically incorrect, is not able to promote his agenda and is an extreme left wing leader who has nothing to be proud of and cannot respect human rights.

Donald Trump is a moron who has been at war with a group of thugs who want to damage the country. Very soon, I will have to go to the Nazis and destroy America."

Three of Trump's supporters, including a previous administration adviser, appeared at a rally for Schumer Thursday night in which Schumer accused Trump of failing to stand up to Bill Clinton during his election campaign.

Early in the Republican primary, Schumer said, Trump "suffers from a gut fear" about Hillary
----------------------------------------
Donald Trump is a moron who is an elephant in the room." Trump was compared to a giant elephant by an onetime political commentator, according to Newsmax. "The president from the beginning is a moron. How do you deal with him?" Trump was overstating his gamemanship, according to some interviewers.

Trump continued his decision to sideline Rubio on CNN before he nearly pushed Hillary Clinton to the floor. A voice said, "Merry Christmas there." (By contrast
----------------------------------------
Donald Trump is a moron who made a fortune off his failing home-brew keg business. After Hickenlooper sued a professional brewer he left for Trump the next year for what was described in the lawsuit as a breach of contract.

Now that the bottles of these beers have been released, the bitter irony of him getting ripped off in the process is starting to get to us.

Trump has a need to pay Trump for the replacement of him with a qualified alternative. Who

Donald Trump is a moron who has caused economic damage to the U.S., Vladimir Putin accused the U.S. of being so weak it was willing to use nuclear weapons to attack Iran if it failed to comply.

Trump responded: "I don't know, because everybody knows this."

The 28th President of the United States to meet with foreign leaders, Donald Trump has been both blunt and confrontational.

For instance, in an interview on CNN last week Trump

Donald Trump is a moron who knows how to get us back to where he's come from. Not just the last few days, but even the battle between his word-speaking, indecent, desperate allies and less safe, desperate foes.

There are no details from Trump's mental illness, but I'd imagine he has deep distress problems but understands that they don't necessarily mean him any harm or destruction. (Or at least, not much.) And Trump is engaging in a bizarre scheme to
----------------------------------------
Donald Trump is a moron who can tell you what you want or need because there is no practical reason for Trump to spend money on ads bashing Hillary Clinton.

The media and opinion-based news organizations associated with right-wing news organizations have been doing this all along. You could make the case that one of the two acts of protest in presidential election season is to actually demonstrate against a corporation.

Just listen to Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, he would've done the same and

True, the list has continued to grow, thanks to the late Susan Rice, the former head of the CIA who was fired as national security adviser after criticism of how she handled government surveillance and others. And of course, if one were to take Trump and Pence's win at the ballot box, it would come down to their philosophy on how to confront the challenges they're
----------------------------------------
Donald Trump is a moron who would work everywhere and do nothing about unfair treatment of young people.

He is going to be the one who defunds Planned Parenthood and the Hyde Park Planned Parenthood, and hell, he is going to be the one who orders all rape survivors to stop speaking up.

They can still do that. They can still be persuaded to talk.

But for his supporters, they should come to these protests at the Capitol every day because he doesn't have

Donald Trump is a moron who no longer thinks the United States should exist, and has even failed to deliver on his promise to ban Muslims from entering the United States.

His campaign unveiled its campaign strategy Saturday, touting the idea that an already liberal country would experience calamitous economic and health disparities and worse life expectancy if it stopped importing Trump's rhetoric, even though it is true that Muslims in the United States are at higher risk for mental illness, violent crimes and other illness,
----------------------------------------
Donald Trump is a moron who may even be desperate to prove he is the most powerful person in the world. But this may not come as much of a surprise when his daughter has informed him that she is the presumptive nominee of the Democratic Party.

As Trump turned the corner after their wedding last February, the family made a surprise visit to the U.S. Embassy in Saudi Arabia. In May 2016, the Trump and his wife registered their campaign to participate in a hearing on American influence
